        <p>While Earth orbits the sun, the planet is simultaneously spinning
             on an imaginary line called an axis that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole.
              It takes Earth 23.934 hours to complete a rotation on its axis and 365.26 days to complete an orbit around the sun.
            </p>
            <p>Earth's axis of rotation is tilted in relation to the ecliptic plane, an imaginary surface through the planet's
                 orbit around the sun. This means the Northern and Southern hemispheres will sometimes point toward
                  or away
                  from the sun depending on the time of year,
                 and this changes the amount of light the hemispheres receive, resulting in the seasons.</p>
                 <p>Earth's orbit is not a perfect circle, but rather an oval-shaped ellipse, similar to the orbits of all the other
                      planets. Our planet is a bit closer to the sun in early January and farther away in July, although this
                       variation has a much smaller effect than the heating and cooling caused by the tilt of Earth's axis.
                        Earth happens to lie within the so-called "Goldilocks zone"
                      around the sun, where temperatures are just right to maintain liquid water on our planet's surface.</p>
